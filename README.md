## About This Laravel Assignment
This Laravel Assignment is based on my group's last php assignment about Toronto Gallery Guide website.

I created 3 tables for this database related to museums, comments, and users. Basically, The users table has one to many relationships with the comments table and the museums table has one to many relationships with the comments table.
